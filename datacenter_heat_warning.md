# 🔥 DATACENTER THERMAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

## Current GPU Load
- **5x RTX A5000 GPUs** running simultaneously
- **Power consumption**: ~230W per GPU = 1,150W total
- **Heat output**: ~3,927 BTU/hour
- **Training duration**: 30-45 minutes per character

## Projected Thermal Impact
```
🌡️  BEFORE: Normal datacenter temperature
🔥  DURING: +3°F temperature rise
🌋  PEAK:   All 5 GPUs at 100% utilization
```

## Office Character Training Heat Map
```
Michael:  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (Management delusion generates maximum heat)
Dwight:   🔥🔥🔥🔥   (Beet farming intensity)
Creed:    🔥🔥🔥     (Chaotic energy output)
Erin:     🔥🔥       (Confused but trying)
Toby:     🔥         (HR compliance generates minimal heat)
```

## Cooling System Response
- **Fans**: Spinning up to maximum RPM
- **AC units**: Working overtime
- **Technicians**: Wondering why the Office dataset is melting the servers
- **Power grid**: Slightly concerned

## Environmental Impact
- **Carbon footprint**: Worth it for AI Michael Scott
- **Global warming**: Accelerated by 0.00001%
- **Polar ice caps**: Melting slightly faster
- **The Office fans**: Absolutely thrilled

## Emergency Protocols
1. If temperature exceeds safe limits:
   - Pause Toby training first (lowest priority)
   - Keep Michael training at all costs
2. If cooling systems fail:
   - Emergency "That's what she said" protocols
3. If datacenter catches fire:
   - Blame Ryan for starting the fire
