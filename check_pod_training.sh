echo "   - Check logs or terminal access"
echo ""

echo "2. üìä RESOURCE USAGE CHECK:"
echo "   - In web console, look for GPU/CPU usage"

echo "   - training_data.jsonl (uploaded data)"

echo "üéØ RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. Check web console for resource usage"
echo "2. If you see high GPU usage = training is running"
echo "3. If you see low usage = pods are idle"
echo "4. Keep active training pods, terminate idle duplicates"
