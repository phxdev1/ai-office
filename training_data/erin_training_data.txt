Erin: If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Really?
Erin: Why was she in this building?
Erin: That's crazy.
Erin: Oh my god!
Erin: Hmm.
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Just got some ice.
Erin: Oops!
Erin: So I'll see you guys around!
Erin: Can I help you?
Erin: Country roads, take me home, to the place... Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Erin: Thank you.
Erin: Wow!
Erin: Hi.
Erin: Do I still have a job here?
Erin: I really love your outfit.
Erin: You look like J-Lo.
Erin: Hi.
Erin: Oh, I can go.
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Is--do the people--
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Do they not like me, though?
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest!
Erin: Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Erin: Hi, guys. How you doing?
Erin: Right. I'm sorry.
Erin: Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Erin: Sure.
Erin: Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Erin: Well, I like to swim.
Erin: You have a cool place to come hang.
Erin: Thanks.
Erin: Wow.
Erin: Now I do got it.
Erin: Oh, yeah.
Erin: That's rule #1.
Erin: Whew.
Erin: It's a cafe disco.
Erin: Oh, my God! What happened?
Erin: Yes.
Erin: Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Erin: You're bad.
Erin: Ashley! You made it!
Erin: Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Erin: Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Erin: Thanks.
Erin: Yeah! Boo-yah!
Erin: Kelly has an eating disorder?
Erin: She always eats my lunch.
Erin: We should do something.
Erin: I am so happy you're eating again.
Erin: I heard it from Michael.
Erin: That's really great, you guys.
Erin: Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
Erin: I think he's around here...
Erin: David Wallace is calling.
Erin: Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Erin: Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
Erin: David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Erin: Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Erin: Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Erin: Oh. Gross.
Erin: Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Erin: Oh yeah. What else you got?
Erin: What else you got?
Erin: Are you in a lot of pain?
Erin: People say you cry all the time.
Erin: If you want to sit on this--  I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer.
Erin: Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Erin: Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
Erin: In your schedule it just says nine til noon is "creative space" and I thought this could be part of that.
Erin: You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says "free play."
Erin: Yes?
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: How do you return coffee?
Erin: They're back!
Erin: Hi!
Erin: Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
Erin: Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
Erin: I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
Erin: Oops, sorry.  Oops.
Erin: Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Erin: Pam, we're all set.  Yum.
Erin: Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
Erin: Fun!
Erin: Hi Dwight!
Erin: Night Michael.
Erin: I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
Erin: They said the both of you.
Erin: You're soaking wet.
Erin: Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Erin: Michael, people are asking questions.
Erin: Staples?  Uh, David Wallace called.
Erin: He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
Erin: Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.
Erin: They want you to pay for it.
Erin: Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
Erin: $300.
Erin: Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
Erin: Thanks.
Erin: How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
Erin: Yeah, he is!
Erin: He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
Erin: Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
Erin: These are amazing. You took all these?
Erin: Oh just by like friends.
Erin: Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Erin: Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.
Erin: Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
Erin: How about you?
Erin: Hello.
Erin: Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
Erin: Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
Erin: Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
Erin: I haven't seen it.
Erin: Of course, Nathaniel.
Erin: Where are you taking me?
Erin: Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton.
Erin: No.  Did you?
Erin: I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
Erin: Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.
Erin: I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Erin: Michael? The limo's here for you.
Erin: He said limousine, so...
Erin: It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
Erin: Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those.
Erin: There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say "Delivered." Should I delete all of those?
Erin: That's why you have a "Sent Mail" folder.
Erin: There's about 30 news alerts for "Nip Slip."
Erin: "Nip slip."
Erin: Well...
Erin: Oh, my God.
Erin: Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Erin: Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't.
Erin: We've already rescheduled seven times.
Erin: I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
Erin: Wow!
Erin: You're famous.
Erin: Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
Erin: No.
Erin: No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
Erin: The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think.
Erin: Really?
Erin: I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Erin: Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...
Erin: Seriously?
Erin: Hello. Sorry guys.  Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
Erin: It's so edgy!
Erin: It stings a lot.
Erin: I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Erin: So far no one will admit to it.
Erin: Is it you?
Erin: Seriously?
Erin: What?
Erin: Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Erin: It was a little much Andy.
Erin: What were you thinking?
Erin: I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?
Erin: Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
Erin: Well, I saw them in there.
Erin: I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Erin: No, you?
Erin: Nothing. It's wide open.
Erin: Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
Erin: Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
Erin: Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Erin: You named them?
Erin: Uh, yeah I do remember.  Aw, they love each other.
Erin: Wow, it smells really good too.
Erin: Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
Erin: Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
Erin: Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
Erin: You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
Erin: Who's hungry?
Erin: It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say "Who's hungry?"
Erin: Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Erin: It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
Erin: Oh sure.
Erin: Well.
Erin: Geez louise.
Erin: Well, everyone got one.
Erin: Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Erin: It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
Erin: Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Erin: Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Ooh, spooky. But why?
Erin: I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Erin: Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
Erin: Um, stimulate the nipples.
Erin: Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Erin: There's nothing in it.
Erin: I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Erin: You wanted to see me?
Erin: Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?
Erin: I don't know what to say.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Erin: I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.
Erin: I'm sure he'll be fine.
Erin: Really?
Erin: I don't want anyone to die.
Erin: Hi.
Erin: Did you grow up around here?
Erin: So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Erin: Hey.
Erin: I have really enjoyed our time together.
Erin: I want to continue working on our friendship.
Erin: Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Erin: And, you're my friend.
Erin: And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe...
Erin: Well...
Erin: Okay, good.
Erin: It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Erin: You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.
Erin: You read the fax.
Erin: Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Erin: Yes. Do you have a day in mind?
Erin: Everyday is fine. Or...
Erin: Thursday?
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Welcome back, "Dad!"
Erin: Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!
Erin: Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Erin: Yes.
Erin: I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Erin: This fax came for you.
Erin: Uh...
Erin: Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Erin: Well...
Erin: Oh! Andy!
Erin: I'm in my jammy-jams!
Erin: Oh, thanks. Come in!
Erin: Your hand's cold.
Erin: Yeah, have some more blanket.
Erin: You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
Erin: He's my foster brother.
Erin: Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them!
Erin: None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Erin: Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
Erin: I'm so sorry I was so sick.
Erin: Something came for you, Michael.
Erin: Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.  I hid the leads.
Erin: Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot.  Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Erin: Lower.
Erin: Lower
Erin: I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Erin: Go on. I have warm blood.
Erin: Sure, if you are.
Erin: Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Erin: Exactly.
Erin: Quiet.
Erin: What's this game?
Erin: Oh I know.
Erin: 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
Erin: Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
Erin: No.
Erin: I get it.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
Erin: What we said to do.
Erin: I was flirting with a man.
Erin: The movies. I don't know.
Erin: You love drama.
Erin: Oh, thank you.
Erin: Thank you.
Erin: Welcome back!
Erin: I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Erin: Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Erin: I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Erin: Just the two of us.
Erin: Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
Erin: I would have chosen the 1490's.
Erin: 'Cause America was discovered.
Erin: And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Erin: Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Erin: How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Erin: He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Erin: Yeah I love that.
Erin: What?
Erin: Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Erin: Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Erin: They had sex?
Erin: Uhhhh, they were engaged?
Erin: Uh-oh...
Erin: In the Foster home, my hair was my room.
Erin: Lunch was fine.
Erin: I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
Erin: God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
Erin: I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Erin: I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Erin: Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Erin: Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Erin: Who are you?! I don't know you!
Erin: Thanks.
Erin: You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Erin: Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Erin: I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Erin: Really?
Erin: It was Andy, wasn't it?
Erin: I hope you find what you're looking for.
Erin: Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Erin: How long were you guys together?
Erin: A year? You were together for a year?
Erin: I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Erin: Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
Erin: I can't trust Andy anymore.
Erin: It's Andy's fault.
Erin: Oh, I like his butt.
Erin: You tricked me!
Erin: Buenos dias, Miguel.  Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Erin: Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Erin: I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Erin: Mm!
Erin: Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Erin: Great.
Erin: Kelly got into the minority training program.
Erin: Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Erin: Uh, no.  Wait, yes.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Erin: Do you want me to go back to the store?
Erin: This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Erin: After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Erin: That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
Erin: We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Erin: He's coming.
Erin: Hi Michael.
Erin: Thanks, Michael.
Erin: What about Kelly?
Erin: Is this a joke?
Erin: Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Erin: Andy?
Erin: I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Yes, of course.
Erin: Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
Erin: Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
Erin: That's a really tight argument.
Erin: Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Erin: Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
Erin: I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
Erin: Yeah!
Erin: I don't know.
Erin: Dwight
Erin: Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
Erin: Andy?
Erin: Did you write this?
Erin: Who did?
Erin: Who is he?
Erin: I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Erin: Oh, who else is going?
Erin: Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Erin: I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
Erin: I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Erin: I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Erin: Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
Erin: Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Erin: Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
Erin: Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
Erin: Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
Erin: Okay, I kill you now.
Erin: This is awesome.  Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup.  Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Thank you.
Erin: Terrific!
Erin: Andy...
Erin: Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?
Erin: Unplanned pregnancy.
Erin: Your two o'clock.
Erin: Gotcha.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Kelly! Great costume!
Erin: He says no.
Erin: A... S... S... H... E... T?
Erin: Ah!  That's enough.
Erin: Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
Erin: Di-Did you say vampire?
Erin: I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
Erin: Get in quick.
Erin: So it's faster.
Erin: Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Erin: No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Erin: Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
Erin: I bet. You guys.
Erin: Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Erin: They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house.
Erin: It's pronounced wacko.
Erin: Michael!
Erin: Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
Erin: Yeah it's a TV show...
Erin: Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Erin: Okay, sorry.
Erin: Wait which one?
Erin: Good me too!
Erin: I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
Erin: Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Erin: You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Erin: Why would I keep you from coming?
Erin: Why would I hide it!
Erin: It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Erin: Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Erin: Those posters used to be real French ads.
Erin: The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting!
Erin: I wasn't recording it.
Erin: Wait, why do you have to record it?
Erin: Jim.
Erin: Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some  help so,  he was wondering if you could help him.
Erin: Look who I found!
Erin: Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Erin: Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Erin: What's the longest thing you've ever seen?  For me it was the tale from Jets.
Erin: Are you having a good time?
Erin: Andy you look awful!
Erin: Are you alright?
Erin: Oh, uhm, like three months.
Erin: I don't know.
Erin: I have to go Phyllis.
Erin: You did this?
Erin: Why don't you like him?
Erin: I care if you like him.
Erin: Okay...
Erin: What?
Erin: Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Erin: You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do.
Erin: I hate your roof!
Erin: I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Erin: I hate it! I hate your car!
Erin: Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
Erin: Sure.
Erin: Pam.
Erin: I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
Erin: Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
Erin: But it's not for--
Erin: All that color.
Erin: How was the dentist?
Erin: Oh, no.
Erin: Oh my God.
Erin: According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
Erin: What's America gonna do?
Erin: What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
Erin: I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
Erin: Fire him. No, show mercy.
Erin: Right, yes.
Erin: I didn't want to miss it.
Erin: Good.
Erin: Guys, who's Holly?
Erin: Wow.
Erin: I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Erin: Oh...
Erin: Hello.
Erin: I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
Erin: Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
Erin: To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Erin: Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
Erin: I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
Erin: That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Erin: No.
Erin: I really think you're better off.
Erin: Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Erin: Hello.
Erin: I know who you are, and I think you should go.
Erin: Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry.
Erin: Okay, champagne.
Erin: Sponge.
Erin: Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Erin: Ukulele's happy?
Erin: Chocolates.
Erin: Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Erin: And did you get the tickets?
Erin: I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Erin: Go!
Erin: Oh, yeah!
Erin: Want some company?
Erin: I went to Portugal.
Erin: No.
Erin: Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Erin: Hey! Gabe.
Erin: This is all I could find.
Erin: One, two, three.  I did it! I did a cartwheel!
Erin: You want to keep this?
Erin: Do you want to keep this?
Erin: Do you want to keep this?
Erin: Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
Erin: Oh it's...
Erin: Michael?
Erin: Ooh. Wait, Michael?
Erin: Down... there.  Is "jlp" a word?
Erin: No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp... I jlp you!"
Erin: I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
Erin: The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen "The Shining", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
Erin: Really?
Erin: Yes.
Erin: Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes.
Erin: Uh...
Erin: Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
Erin: The cow jumped over the moon.
Erin: Wait. Why?
Erin: When I win...
Erin: We're gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
Erin: Yes.
Erin: Apoplexy.
Erin: Got it.  Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
Erin: I played "ape."
Erin: I know. You get to pick.
Erin: Yes?
Erin: There's a "Shrek" two?!
Erin: Ohh.
Erin: Oh my gosh!
Erin: Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Erin: You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Erin: It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Erin: He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
Erin: No.
Erin: Hey, you were in there forever.
Erin: She wandered off like an idiot.
Erin: Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
Erin: It's Michael!
Erin: You knew.
Erin: Where did he go, Holly?
Erin: Okay. We fan out...
Erin: Good. We don't need her.
Erin: From my secret admirer. That's you!
Erin: "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
Erin: But, there's no clue.
Erin: I can't, 'cause there's no clue.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Psst! Psst!
Erin: Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
Erin: Yes!
Erin: Oh, is he...
Erin: Andy.
Erin: So tell me about your new girlfriend.
Erin: Aww, cute.
Erin: That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
Erin: No, come on.
Erin: Come on!
Erin: Ha!
Erin: Don't mind us. You keep working.
Erin: Oh, my God. It's a song.
Erin: What do you think is on it?
Erin: Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
Erin: Darryl.
Erin: No, he's not.
Erin: Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Erin: What do you...
Erin: I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Erin: Oh. Cool.
Erin: Super romantic.
Erin: Yeah. Did you not see it?
Erin: Hanks.
Erin: Sorry.
Erin: Oh. One Erin Special, please.
Erin: That's my favorite.
Erin: B-9.
Erin: Like a benign tumor.
Erin: Oh, yes. There's a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss."
Erin: Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm
Erin: Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
Erin: Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Erin: Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there.  Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Erin: Thank you Pam.
Erin: Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!
Erin: Pam gave it to me!
Erin: I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Erin: Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon.  Thanks.
Erin: If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Erin: Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Erin: For Pete's sake it just needs to be done!
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Erin: Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Erin: Oh, assist.
Erin: Yeah, ok, good.
Erin: What do you think?
Erin: ...I'm so sorry. Sorry.
Erin: Deangelo, did you order a barber?
Erin: Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Erin: Deangelo, this box came for you.
Erin: Oh hey, didn't see you.
Erin: I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!!
Erin: Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Erin: Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Erin: Please! Sorry. Get in.  Sorry sorry sorry.
Erin: I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Erin: I, really don't like spending time with him.
Erin: Thank you Jim.
Erin: I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Erin: DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
Erin: Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life.  People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Erin: I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam?  Thank you for hearing me.
Erin: Gabe!
Erin: You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
Erin: Hey Creed.
Erin: I really think you should leave.
Erin: Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Erin: Gabe!
Erin: I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Erin: Andy.
Erin: I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Erin: I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Erin: Extension 147.
Erin: I know.
Erin: Absolutely.
Erin: Deangelo?
Erin: Who should I say is calling?
Erin: Ooh, about what?
Erin: I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Erin: Oh! Darryl's funny.
Erin: 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or -
Erin: He's just gonna call back.
Erin: What?
Erin: Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Erin: I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Erin: Andy!
Erin: I'll go with you.
Erin: Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Erin: She had so much -
Erin: Hey.
Erin: It's good. I really hope you get it!
Erin: Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Erin: You in the boss's chair!
Erin: Did you hear anything?
Erin: So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Erin: Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Erin: But why not find out.
Erin: I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Erin: I... I don't think I can do that.
Erin: Well, that's not my personality.
Erin: Yes?
Erin: I do really want him.
Erin: Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Erin: He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Erin: Ahh!
Erin: I've been turned into a puppet!
Erin: I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Erin: And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Erin: I need the most special thing in the office.
Erin: A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard!
Erin: Oh.
Erin: I've done it all my life.
Erin: I see it.  I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of  and facing, and I'm like...
Erin: Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don’t.&nbsp; And I don’t.&nbsp; But I am so excited to be a part of it.
Erin: Here we go.
Erin: Robert California. Let’s have a conversation.
Erin: Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
Erin: Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I’ve been doing this thing-
Erin: Pam, pam. Psst. Pam.
Erin: No.
Erin: Andy, don’t go in there!
Erin: I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Erin: Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
Erin: Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
Erin: Justine. She said she’s coming by later.
Erin: Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you’re here?
Erin: Oh, sorry.
Erin: Oh
Erin: Yeah. It’s old.
Erin: I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said “coffee”….
Erin: Andy, you don’t want that.
Erin: Sorry.
Erin: Yes!
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
Erin: What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
Erin: Well I have an idea.
Erin: What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.
Erin: I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
Erin: I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.
Erin: There's a dog in the car.
Erin: As long as you guys don't need me up here.
Erin: I didn't feel anything.
Erin: You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!
Erin: You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Erin: And we did.
Erin: Jim? Tell them what it's called.
Erin: Jim...
Erin: Why's it so far away?
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
Erin: Good...
Erin: Six months.
Erin: Ahh!
Erin: I think we should toast...
Erin: It's either taping or calling.
Erin: Sorry.
Erin: Here you go.
Erin: When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
Erin: Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
Erin: That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
Erin: Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
Erin: That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
Erin: Yeah...
Erin: Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
Erin: Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Erin: Oh, I put those up.
Erin: I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
Erin: Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Erin: But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
Erin: Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
Erin: Gabe?
Erin: I’m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Erin: Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn’t stop crying?
Erin: Ok. Let’s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just… more adult… more… scary and sexy
Erin: No – just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Erin: What are you thinking?
Erin: Witch’s brew?
Erin: I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!
Erin: Thanks. It’s on medium.
Erin: Oh, so we don’t have to have that talk.
Erin: Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.
Erin: I’m sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now . This game is called “pecker Poker”.  It’s the game of cards that gets you hard.
Erin: All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so…
Erin: Sure.
Erin: And she’s never called here. Unless it’s your mom.
Erin: Two dates? Three dates?
Erin: Wow. I’m so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I’ll see you guys.
Erin: I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Erin: I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
Erin: Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Erin: You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
Erin: Dwight's car is gone.
Erin: Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
Erin: Do you need a hand?
Erin: Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Erin: Haho!
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Who’s calling?
Erin: You’re not going to take it?
Erin: Ohohohoh.
Erin: You’re not going to get it though?
Erin: Copy that.
Erin: Andy.
Erin: You have a very important call.
Erin: Are you sure? It’s really, really important.
Erin: Really? Because your mother is dead.
Erin: She’s dead. She was hit by a bus.
Erin: This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.
Erin: Line 2.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Drive carefully!
Erin: It's right here in PA.
Erin: I'm in.
Erin: Cool. Thanks.
Erin: Yeah, but I'm confused...
Erin: Mm-hmm.
Erin: Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Erin: Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
Erin: Interesting.
Erin: No!
Erin: Get out of here!
Erin: Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
Erin: No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
Erin: There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
Erin: Nothing, I just-
Erin: That it'll be the first shipment out today.
Erin: Hoo-hoo!
Erin: Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Erin: Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Erin: Here you go.
Erin: Well that's a sales desk.
Erin: That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Erin: He just rolled out and crawled out.
Erin: Um, where's the shower?
Erin: I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
Erin: Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
Erin: That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
Erin: Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug.  I'm Erin.
Erin: Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Erin: Wow.
Erin: Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
Erin: Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
Erin: OK.
Erin: Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
Erin: Hit 'er up.
Erin: Yeah!
Erin: I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie.  and then I want my nap!
Erin: Whoo!  Thank you.
Erin: Thank you.
Erin: A thousand.
Erin: Maybe you should mind your own business.  Just kidding!
Erin: Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK?  And you both have such beautiful hair.
Erin: I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
Erin: And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss.  Ah!  OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say “get a drink”.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Every martini has an olive.
Erin: Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
Erin: It's about you.
Erin: It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
Erin: I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Erin: Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar?
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Game on.
Erin: I would like another alcohol.
Erin: And...
Erin: And you have any advice or anything?
Erin: ...Help me feel better...
Erin: Thank you, goodnight.
Erin: Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Erin: Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Erin: Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
Erin: What is it?
Erin: I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl.
Erin: Flying jib.
Erin: Yeah!
Erin: Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Erin: I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
Erin: I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Erin: Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
Erin: How do you know where I live?
Erin: Why?
Erin: Oh. Come on.
Erin: Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.
Erin: Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Erin: How is everything? How's your car?
Erin: Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Erin: Oh, like a goodbye trip.
Erin: Hi.
Erin: I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
Erin: Hey, Dwight Snoot.
Erin: What you doing?
Erin: Ow.
Erin: Come on, don't you want to play?
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
Erin: Oh Dwight!
Erin: Stop.
Erin: No, you stop.
Erin: Is he looking?  Oh. You can stop.
Erin: No, no, no, he's not looking.
Erin: You can actually stop.
Erin: Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Erin: What is the most romantic possible thing?
Erin: Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
Erin: Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Erin: Dang it! What the heck already?
Erin: Yes! Woo!
Erin: Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
Erin: He's not looking.  Hey!
Erin: Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Erin: One more?
Erin: Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
Erin: Go! Okay. Yeah.
Erin: I've got this!  Charge! Go! Go!
Erin: Sure. Sure we did.
Erin: Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
Erin: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Erin: So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
Erin: The Bernard family seal. Duh.
Erin: Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Erin: Oh, you weren't going to do that?
Erin: Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
Erin: Oh, Dwight.
Erin: That feels so good!
Erin: Hey, Andy.
Erin: Dwight gives the best back massages.
Erin: I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute.
Erin: You mean more like dangerous curves...
Erin: Ow!
Erin: You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?
Erin: I'm ready.
Erin: Ok.
Erin: Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
Erin: What was the case?
Erin: Ooh, "the case of the hit and run," that's exciting.
Erin: Ah! Angela had the baby!
Erin: Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
Erin: We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Erin: Got it, bimbo.
Erin: He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
Erin: Is he really five pounds?
Erin: Because I squat with five pounds. This-  yeah, this feels like more than that.
Erin: Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
Erin: Hi.
Erin: Hey, aren't you an actor?
Erin: Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
Erin: And here's the fax for you.
Erin: Ah! Love to learn.
Erin: So...
Erin: We're pin twins.
Erin: Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.
Erin: For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
Erin: Absolutely. Works for me.
Erin: Hey guys, any spots left?
Erin: I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Erin: Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
Erin: Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
Erin: I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Erin: Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.  Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Erin: Goodbye for a very very long time.
Erin: Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Erin: Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day!
Erin: Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
Erin: What do you think happened?
Erin: Hey, are you okay?
Erin: Who says none of us are diarrheal?
Erin: Yeah!
Erin: Jim, are you in?
Erin: How long will he be gone?
Erin: Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Erin: Packer's giving one.  Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
Erin: Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
Erin: Do a hundred jumping jacks.
Erin: I don't feel like it either!
Erin: Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
Erin: Retail consumer habits.
Erin: Convenience.
Erin: Service.
Erin: Building loyalty.
Erin: Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Erin: I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
Erin: And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Erin: Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Erin: A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Erin: I'm moving down here, you know.
Erin: I'm young, and I can … and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Whoa. the lights are still on.
Erin: I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Erin: Hello, waffle iron.
Erin: Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl…
Erin: … a measuring cup…
Erin: It's the fuzz!
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: A lot of fun.
Erin: You should move down here with me.
Erin: We could be roommates.
Erin: We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Erin: Maybe in six months-
Erin: Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Erin: Hey, my name’s Tabitha. I’m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It’s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it’s working. There’s already people camped out behind me.
Erin: I was ahead of you!
Erin: Come on. I was in line before you.
Erin: Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don’t want to leave yet. I haven’t had so much fun since seeing… zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Erin: We are closed! Come on.
Erin: Sorry about kicking you out. It’s just, we don’t want our brand associated with death.
Erin: You’re not married yet?
Erin: My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we’re not really friends.
Erin: Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
Erin: Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Erin: I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Erin: Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her.  I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Erin: Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida.
Erin: Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
Erin: Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Erin: Can you just do it?
Erin: 'Erin123'
Erin: All right.
Erin: That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop.  Oh. I fixed it.
Erin: Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Erin: This is a tanned spot.
Erin: Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
Erin: I have a job here. I work for an old lady.
Erin: Andy?
Erin: Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Erin: How are you? How's your family doing?
Erin: Bye.
Erin: Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money.  Listen to me, bragging away.
Erin: I'm in the bathroom.
Erin: Yes.
Erin: Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Erin: Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Erin: Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Erin: Hey... don't listen.
Erin: Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
Erin: So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Erin: You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Erin: Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there.
Erin: I've heard that's amazing when it works.
Erin: Andy, I care about you and I think--
Erin: No, go ahead.
Erin: Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Erin: You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
Erin: I know.
Erin: Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Erin: Irene, what would you do without me?
Erin: Why?
Erin: Andy wait!  Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I’m sorry.
Erin: Andy.
Erin: Let's get out of here.
Erin: Let's go.
Erin: No, I don't have any stuff.
Erin: I don't have one.
Erin: No.
Erin: I just... there's always one around.
Erin: I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Erin: Going to Pennsylvania.
Erin: Oh. That must be nice.
Erin: Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Erin: No.
Erin: Yes.
Erin: Yes. So do I.
Erin: Important.
Erin: Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Erin: I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Erin: What?
Erin: What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.
Erin: So, I'm Erin. Hi.
Erin: Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
Erin: Andy-
Erin: No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Erin: But... they're penises.
Erin: Maybe we should just go.
Erin: That was a really rough scene.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Oh, yeah.
Erin: Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Erin: Probably from seeing that turkey.
Erin: When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Erin: What? Why are we-
Erin: Uh-oh!
Erin: ...his girlfriend's back!
Erin: Thank you.
Erin: When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Erin: There you go.  Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Erin: Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Erin: We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Erin: Really. It's not a big deal.
Erin: When you lost the manager job-
Erin: Did it affect you outside of the office?
Erin: I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Erin: Oh, okay.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Okay, okay.
Erin: Dwight!
Erin: You promised!
Erin: Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Erin: Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here!  Take 'em yourself!
Erin: And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
Erin: And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Erin: Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Erin: Here-
Erin: But you hurt your hand.
Erin: Right now?
Erin: Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
Erin: Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Erin: Andy's just coming as my date.
Erin: Oh God!
Erin: He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Erin: You're going to be alright
Erin: So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Andy, if you’re gonna hang out for a while, uh…
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Erin: No, of course not. It’s just – I think it’s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it’s like, where does it end? So just…
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Erin: There’s a call for you on line one.
Erin: He says salvation. No last name.
Erin: Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line.
Erin: I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Erin: But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Erin: Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Erin: No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
Erin: He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
Erin: No, he's not making this up.
Erin: Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Erin: Oh my God.
Erin: Andy’s coming back today! Andy’s coming back today! Ha! Andy’s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Erin: I’m so happy for you Kelly.
Erin: Andy’s coming back today!
Erin: Andy’s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy’s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy’s here. Pam, he’s here.
Erin: Yeah, you know, like  guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh… guh.
Erin: Yeah, seriously, it’s like everything on there is work.
Erin: Oh, Pete, you’ve got mail.
Erin: Well, it’s addressed to Customer Service so, it’s your mail.
Erin: Yeah, I’m alternating.
Erin: Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
Erin: Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It’s not a nice letter.
Erin: Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
Erin: You mean, put me on the news?
Erin: Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
Erin: Whoo!
Erin: I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: No, I watch the news.
Erin: This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
Erin: Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
Erin: A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
Erin: For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon.
Erin: For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
Erin: Got it. For Channel 11 news...
Erin: I'm Erin Hannon.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: Oh god.
Erin: Tuh.
Erin: The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Erin: Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Erin: Aw!
Erin: Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
Erin: I'm hungry.
Erin: OK.
Erin: Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
Erin: Heyyy! Study buddies!
Erin: Getting things done. Awesome!
Erin: S”il vous plait…dites-Moi…Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Erin: I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Erin: Yeah! Let’s do it!
Erin: Oh!
Erin: I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, “What's your stance on politics?” Or, “What is the best war to do?” And, I will just be like, “Duhhhh!”
Erin: Foth aggendak!
Erin: Foth aggendi!
Erin: Foth aggenda!
Erin: Forth aggenda!
Erin: Wah!! Aggenda!!
Erin: Addor!
Erin: Qazer!
Erin: Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
Erin: Vos!
Erin: Because of your slaves.
Erin: Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for “slave master”, “attafrauk!”, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
Erin: Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
Erin: Dothraas! chek!
Erin: Hmmm!
Erin: Sorry.
Erin: I'm trying. Sorry.
Erin: Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
Erin: I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe?  Oh well.
Erin: Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Erin: Just don't tell Andy, because..
Erin: Yes!
Erin: Yeah Jim!
Erin: Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
Erin: Never say that.
Erin: I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Erin: Hey guys.
Erin: Pam, what are you?
Erin: No, I’m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Erin: Uh, Jim, you’re not dressed up at all.
Erin: Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
Erin: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Erin: Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Erin: What is with these turkeys?
Erin: Hey! You better do ‘Faith.’ You get me?
Erin: So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you’re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin’ song.
Erin: Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please.  This isn’t stupid.
Erin: The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it’s kind of pathetic. But when you’re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Erin: Are you okay?
Erin: Okay!
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Oh well, Andy, we’re not moving to Cornell.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Oy. Andy, what’s going on?
Erin: Well, um, you know maybe you’re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
Erin: Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
Erin: Oh.
Erin: What’s wrong?
Erin: She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Erin: Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Erin: See? I bet you wouldn’t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Erin: Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy.  He's seriously juvenile.
Erin: Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
Erin: Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.
Erin: Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Erin: Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
Erin: Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
Erin: Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
Erin: Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Erin: Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
Erin: Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Erin: Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
Erin: Alright.
Erin: Let's do it!
Erin: That's yours?
Erin: Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
Erin: I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Erin: Gee, he was salty.
Erin: What does that one do?
Erin: I wish I had seen you do it.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
Erin: Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
Erin: As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Nice!
Erin: Do you even know what you're doing?
Erin: Bahamas, Andy.
Erin: Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
Erin: Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
Erin: OK!
Erin: Thanks for covering the phones.
Erin: Fine.
Erin: Does he have a flipper?
Erin: He sounds like an idiot.
Erin: Ok.
Erin: Thanks.
Erin: Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family’s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
Erin: Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
Erin: He’s in the bathroom.
Erin: Of course.
Erin: Eat it Stanley!
Erin: Hello.
Erin: I am? Hmm..  Hi, I’m Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?
Erin: He’s absolutely right. I’m really struggling.
Erin: It’s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
Erin: Yes.
Erin: Uh!
Erin: Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
Erin: I know. That’s great. It just - it makes it look like there’s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
Erin: A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn’t bad.
Erin: But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It’s such a great cause.
Erin: Yay!
Erin: Whoo!
Erin: Um,. it’s empty.
Erin: Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They’re family-owned, but don’t let that take away from your edge!
Erin: Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file.  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
Erin: Yeah!
Erin: Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
Erin: I mean, it says "X-Mas party," but I think we all know what that's code for.
Erin: Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
Erin: I haven't seen it.
Erin: Mm-Mmm.
Erin: I don't know, I just haven't.
Erin: No.
Erin: None of this makes any sense to me!
Erin: Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Erin: Okay, let's hear it.
Erin: Die hard. Every line. Go.
Erin: Don't change the subject.
Erin: Movie is starting.
Erin: Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
Erin: I don't know. This looks pretty legit.  Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Erin: "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."
Erin: So what comes next?
Erin: We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Erin: No. No more talking. It's movie time.
Erin: Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
Erin: Mm.
Erin: Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Erin: I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Erin: But you can leave your arm.
Erin: Good morning, Meredith.
Erin: Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
Erin: Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
Erin: Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Erin: Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
Erin: Next!
Erin: Lice. More lice.  Angela has lice.
Erin: Ooh yabber, lice!
Erin: Yikers, lice.
Erin: Oh yeah, big time lice.
Erin: No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!
Erin: I'm trying to save you from yourself!
Erin: No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
Erin: To be washed.
Erin: No, all we need is mayonnaise.
Erin: Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
Erin: Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
Erin: Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
Erin: Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Erin: Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Erin: I feel it working.  Eiffel tower!
Erin: Dwight, are you okay!?
Erin: Wow. He got to purple.
Erin: You're up.
Erin: You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Erin: Okay. Okay.  Is that too cold?
Erin: Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
Erin: What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it’s in order? I  haven’t been trained for this.
Erin: Hi guys!
Erin: Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
Erin: Thank you!
Erin: I don’t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone’s trust. About the pens.
Erin: The pen delivery went amazing, and now I’ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I’m not one of those people who’s just like, “Uh, sure. I’ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back’s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand… they are just sitting here. Pam didn’t tell me not to unpack them. Don’t want to be a busybody, but I don’t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it’s insane! I’m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I’ve never had an espresso before. They’re good though.
Erin: No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it’s the truth, I swear.
Erin: No, I’m not!  It’s not like that at all! Forget it, I’m so sorry.
Erin: Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you’ve had.
Erin: You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That’s what happened. The pens happened.
Erin: Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
Erin: It’s just Pete in sunglasses.
Erin: And then we had him “Like” Dunder Mifflin.
Erin: So far, we’re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
Erin: All right.
Erin: Pete and I work well together -- not that there’s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I’m into girls. Not that I’m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Erin: Oh, my gosh!
Erin: Wow. That guy’s really into paper.
Erin: We did it. Youth task force forever.
Erin: No, you go -- okay.
Erin: Oh, I’m sorry. Didn’t you cheat on Andy?
Erin: I’m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven’t done anything.
Erin: Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that’s the end of it. Right, Pete?
Erin: Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I’m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
Erin: Hello, Peter.
Erin: Oh, no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea.
Erin: I guess we don’t have a choice.
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
Erin: Pam, phone call.
Erin: He's around here somewhere.
Erin: Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
Erin: Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
Erin: Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
Erin: Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Erin: Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guy's hilarious. He's here today.
Erin: Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
Erin: I thought that's what you were doing.
Erin: Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Erin: I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Erin: Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
Erin: We can do anything you want.
Erin: I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
Erin: Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
Erin: Great.
Erin: Perfect.
Erin: Andy!
Erin: Yes.  Welcome back, buddy.
Erin: Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
Erin: I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
Erin: He only emailed me four times.
Erin: Hey!
Erin: Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
Erin: Fish sounds great.
Erin: Really playing the scales, huh?
Erin: I don't love you anymore.
Erin: I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
Erin: I just said there isn't love.
Erin: I guess.
Erin: You got really sunburned.
Erin: Ugh.
Erin: You really think we can get that back?
Erin: Hi.
Erin: I couldn't do it.
Erin: I'm sorry.
Erin: We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
Erin: Good morning.
Erin: Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Erin: I...
Erin: ..just have some messages for you.
Erin: Well no, they're from clients.
Erin: I can't. I-
Erin: These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Erin: Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Erin: Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Erin: Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Erin: See? We can all be friends!
Erin: Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Erin: Hi.
Erin: Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Erin: Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
Erin: Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
Erin: What, do you two know each other?
Erin: Oh.
Erin: That's so random.
Erin: Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.
Erin: So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Erin: Yeah.
Erin: How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Erin: Gabe!
Erin: Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Erin: Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Erin: I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Erin: Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
Erin: He didn't even say that.
Erin: Gabe, I don't-
Erin: What is that supposed to mean?
Erin: I don't want you to shave everything.
Erin: What do you-!
Erin: Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Erin: What color is it?
Erin: Oh, gosh.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Erin: Hey.
Erin: I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?
Erin: Didn’t you get the memo? It’s Stairmageddon!  Come on Stanley!
Erin: &nbsp;Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It’s a… “Mageddon!”
Erin: Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Erin: &nbsp;Come on!
Erin: Come on. You got this. Here.
Erin: “Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.”
Erin: I bet it’s Katie Couric. I’ve been saying this for years.
Erin: Oh, guys, it’s starting! Hurry!
Erin: Andy!
Erin: Oscar is with the Senator too?
Erin: Oh. Hey, champions.
Erin: I did. I got some really good sleep.
Erin: Bzzz.
Erin: Clark's a dead man.
Erin: Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously.
Erin: Hey. Why don't you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Erin: Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Erin: Nice.
Erin: Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
Erin: I can't hear what you said.  You got your slop?
Erin: What?
Erin: Wow.
Erin: Yeah!
Erin: Dammit! Dammit, god.  Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I’m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Erin: Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Erin: Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Erin: Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said “is Indian” and was like, “Is Indian what?” Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Erin: Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy’s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Erin: Yes, there’s Andy! Andy is in. I’m a good receptionist, I know he’s in.
Erin: So true. Is there a question, or are—what?
Erin: Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Erin: I had no idea. And here I’ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin’ sheep.
Erin: Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That’d be fun.
Erin: Well, how about Thursday?
Erin: Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Erin: Close.
Erin: Colder.
Erin: No, I meant you’re getting colder. The correct response is, “the coffee in Peru is much hotter.”
Erin: But, that’s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam.  Unless you want me to break protocol?
Erin: Aw, heck ya!
Erin: Darryl?! Darryl!
Erin: You left us without saying goodbye.
Erin: Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Erin: Get upstairs, mister!
Erin: Oh, god!
Erin: Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl’s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we’ll get this started.
Erin: We have our decision.
Erin: We want to dance with you.
Erin: One dance, all of us together.
Erin: Absolutely.
Erin: Yes!
Erin: Ok, everybody ready?
Erin: You have to change the channel to PBS.
Erin: But there’s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Erin: A paper company.
Erin: Whoo!
Erin: Oh!
Erin: Phyllis!
Erin: How’s Florida?
Erin: Really?
Erin: Thank you.
Erin: Maybe sometimes. But not like “hate” hate. More just like, “Mom, I hate you!” And then she would say “go to your room, young lady.” And I’d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we’d just have dinner together. But I don’t know. I’d have to meet her. Thanks.
Erin: Yes?
Erin: Yes? Is there a follow-up question?  Mom?
Erin: I don’t know. I’ve just always been really good at dancing.
Erin: How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
